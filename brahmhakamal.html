                Brahma Kamal is considered to be a type of cactus. This means that the plant does not require much water and is self-sufficient compared to other plants. 
                If you plan on planting this for yourself, you will find it extremely easy as it needs watering every two to three days. 
                However, it is necessary that you never overwater the plant as that can be hazardous for the plant's life.

                Although the actual Brahma Kamal scientific name is Saussurea obvallata, this flower is named after Brahma, the God of Creation, according to ancient Indian drawings.
                It is also referred to as the Night Blooming Cereus, Queen of the night, and Lady of the night as its lotus-like flowers only open during night time.

                The plant can be easily planted using a 10-15 cm stem from another healthy plant just like a rose plant. The plant's leaves are usually flat and thick, and the flowers grow on the leaves. 
                Brahma Kamal is traditionally a Himalayan plant, and thus chilly weather will help it grow.

                Therefore, it is recommended that you plant it at the start of the winter season. As for the choice of the soil, you would need a very fertile kind of soil that is also somewhat rocky. 
                The purpose of this choice is to resemble the ground soil of the Himalayan mountains as much as possible. This way, the land would be able to retain much of its water for more extended periods.

                According to ancient drawings from India, the God of Creation, Brahma, is sitting on a flower with pink color that looks like a lotus. Lotus is known as Kamal in the Sanskrit language and is the national flower of India.

                It is considered to be the bearer of good blessings and getting the chance of looking at a fully blossomed Brahma Kamal is considered to be a blessing in itself. 
                These Brahma Kamal plant blessings are significant for Hindus.Brahma Kamal comes from the Himalayan mountains, and it is heavily used in traditional medicines under Indian and Tibetan culture.
                The plant is used to treat several diseases such as urogenital disorders, sexually transmitted diseases, liver infections, bone pains, as well as cold and cough.
