                Most true jasmines have climbing branches without tendrils. The white, yellow, or rarely pink flowers are tubular with a flaring, lobed, pinwheel-like form; some double-flowered varieties have been developed. 
                The leaves can be evergreen or deciduous and usually are composed of two or more leaflets, although some species have simple leaves. 
                The fruit in most species is a two-lobed black berry.

                Winter jasmine , a Chinese species with solitary yellow flowers, is used as a cover plant on hillsides. 

                Japanese, or primrose, jasmine is a similar plant with larger flowers that bloom during the winter. Italian jasmine , a vinelike shrub with yellow flowers, has many cultivated varieties.
                The fragrant dried flowers of Arabian jasmine  are used to make jasmine tea.

                Madagascar jasmine , jasmine tobacco , Carolina, or allspice, jasmine , Chilean jasmine , orange jasmine ,
